NAME
    String::JS - Utilities for Javascript string literal representation

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.02 of String::JS (from Perl
    distribution String-JS), released on 2014-07-25.

FUNCTIONS
  encode_js_string($str[, $mode]) => STR
    Encode Perl string $str to its JavaScript literal representation using
    double quotes ("""). This is currently implemented using JSON encoding.

    If $mode is set to 1, will produce literal representation using single
    quotes ("'") instead.

    If $mode is set to 2, will produce single-quoted JS string to be put
    inside a double-quoted JS string literal, useful for producing for
    example jQuery expression like:

     $("h2.contains('this is JS string inside another JS string')")

    Will die on failure.

  decode_js_string($js_str) => STR
    Given a JavaScript string literal representation in $js_str, decode to
    get the value.

    Currently implemented using JSON decoding of stringified $js_str.

    Currently does not support JavaScript string representation that uses
    single quotes ("'").

    Will die on failure.
