NAME
    String::JS - Utilities for Javascript string literal representation

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.01 of String::JS (from Perl
    distribution String-JS), released on 2014-07-25.

FUNCTIONS
  encode_js_string($str) => STR
    Encode Perl string $str to its JavaScript literal representation using
    double quotes ("""). This is currently implemented using JSON encoding.

    An option to produce literal representation using single quotes ("'")
    will be provided in the future.

    Will die on failure.

  decode_js_string($js_str) => STR
    Given a JavaScript string literal representation in $js_str, decode to
    get the value.

    Currently implemented using JSON decoding of stringified $js_str.

    Currently does not support JavaScript string representation that uses
    single quotes ("'").

    Will die on failure.
